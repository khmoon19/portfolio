            A little about me:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Katie Moon. 
            I live in Raleigh, NC with my husband Patrick, our dog Blue, and our cat T'Challa. 
            I graduated from NC State University in 2019 with a degree in Technology, Engineering, and Design Education. 
            I am currently working on my master's degree in STEM Education with a focus on Technology and Engineering Education. 
            I am interested in informal STEM education in applications such as museums and camps. 
            My goal is to make STEM more accessible for everyone. 
        </p>
